> Each directory has `Readme.md` , `notes` directory for handwrittren notes or snippets or txt files (if anyone is interested please make sure they are structured enough to understand).
### Easy to Understand Manner

> All source code is written in java in java-code directory. But you can use any language of your choice just make sure files are structured.


# How to Contribute?
### **Contribute First, Think Later.**

_If you're not comfortable with command line, [here are tutorials using GUI tools.](#tutorials-using-other-tools)_


<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

#### If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git).

## Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.
This will create a copy of this repository in your account.

## Clone the repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone <url>
```

## Create a branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd DSA_Cohort
```

Now create a branch using the `git switch` command:

```
git switch -c your-new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git switch -c add-vasu-jhawar
```

## Make necessary changes and commit those changes

Now open `Contributors.md` file in a text editor, add your name to it. Don't add it at the beginning or end of the file. Put it anywhere in between. Now, save the file.

<img align="right" width="450" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/git-status.png" alt="git status" />

If you go to the project directory and execute the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Add those changes to the branch you just created using the `git add` command:

```
git add Contributors.md
```
Now commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "Add Vasu to Contributors.md"
```

replacing `your-name` with your name.

## Push changes to GitHub

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

replacing `your-branch-name` with the name of the branch you created earlier.

## Submit your changes for review

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button. Click on that button.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/compare-and-pull.png" alt="create a pull request" />

Now submit the pull request.

<img style="float: right;" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/submit-pull-request.png" alt="submit pull request" />

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.


## ALL THE BEST!
